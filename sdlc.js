// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// Implementation
// Testing & Integration
// Maintain


//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "The initial step in which we determine and define software. Based off existing systems, developers will assess what features to add." 
const analysisOfRequirements = "To establish what requirements there are for the software's development."
const design = "In this stage, we focus on how we're going to design the software and make it presentable."
const implementation = "In this step, developers individually or as a team will write out a program for the software."
const testingAndIntegration = "Developers will now test the software to ensure that it runs smoothly and efficiently, catching any bugs or errors along the way."
const maintain = "Once the software product is released, developers will resolve any remaining issues or errors that might come up during a customer's experience with the product."
